# Cloud Computing Concepts

This project passed all of the tests when submitted so I was extremely chuffed.  I used a SWIM style membership and failure detection protocol as recommended by the course notes so that I could learn more than by simply implementing an all-to-all heartbeat.

It was a bit of a journey re-acquanting myself with C-style programming and I was bashing my head against a brick wall when trying to add some vectors to the MP1Node class so that the failures could be managed.  Anyway, I ended up just using 5 hard-coded Address types to enable me to get a version of the code that executed without memory errors.  I would like to understand what was going wrong there though - it would be a useful clarification if I was ever to have to code in C++ again.

It was fun though.  That feeling when the tests finally return with a 100% success rate should be bottled and sold!
